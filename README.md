# doubletake

AirPlay screen mirroring sender for Linux. Streams your desktop to an Apple TV using the AirPlay mirroring protocol.

## Features

- Full AirPlay mirroring protocol (RTSP/HTTP + encrypted video stream)
- FairPlay SAP authentication (clean Go implementation)
- SRP-6a pairing with PIN and persistent credential storage
- Wayland (PipeWire/xdg-desktop-portal) and X11 screen capture
- H.264 encoding with NVENC, VA-API, OpenH264, and x264
- Capability-gated HEVC Main10/high-resolution encoding with NVENC or x265
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 stream encryption
- mDNS device discovery
- Daemon mode with multi-target streaming control (`doubletake-ctl`)
- In-process test receiver for hardware-free pairing and media-flow tests
- Automatic connection-aware screen/audio latency policy with an optional `-target-latency-ms` override
- KDE Plasma widget for quick access (see [plasmoid/](plasmoid/))

## Requirements

- Go 1.23+
- GStreamer 1.0 (with plugins-base, plugins-good, plugins-bad, plugins-ugly, libav)
- PulseAudio utilities (`pactl`; `pulseaudio-utils` on Ubuntu/Debian or the equivalent package on other distributions)
- PipeWire (Wayland) or X11 for screen capture

### Ubuntu/Debian

```sh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav pulseaudio-utils
```

### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad \
  gst-plugins-ugly gst-libav libpulse
```

The `openh264` encoder requires the GStreamer `openh264enc` element, normally
provided by the plugins-bad package. Check availability with
`gst-inspect-1.0 openh264enc`.

You can also install from the AUR:

- [`doubletake`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doubletake) (stable release package)
- [`doubletake-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doubletake-git) (latest from git)
- [`doubletake-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doubletake-bin) (prebuilt binary package)

## Build

```sh
make
```

This builds the three binaries into `bin/`:

- `bin/doubletake`
- `bin/doubletake-ctl`
- `bin/doubletake-test-receiver`

## Install

Install binaries and man pages (default prefix: `/usr/local`):

```sh
sudo make install
```

Use a custom prefix if needed:

```sh
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```

Uninstall:

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

Run tests:

```sh
make test
```

### Optional AAC-ELD support

Doubletake selects screen audio from the receiver's advertised
`supportedFormats.screenStream` mask. Default builds use the built-in ALAC
encoder when the receiver advertises it. AAC-ELD remains an explicit opt-in
because it depends on the system `libfdk-aac` development files and cgo:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags fdk_aac -o bin/doubletake ./cmd/doubletake
```

Install the package that provides the `fdk-aac` pkg-config file and headers for
your distribution before running that command. A default build reports a clear
error if advertised capabilities select AAC-ELD. A nonzero screen-audio mask
which advertises neither ALAC nor AAC-ELD is also rejected instead of silently
sending an unadvertised format. Use `-no-audio` to keep testing pairing, timing,
and video when the advertised audio format is unavailable.

## Firewall

doubletake binds three consecutive local UDP ports for each stream:

- `N`: timing. A receiver-initiated NTP session probes this port during SETUP.
- `N+1`: audio control and receiver retransmission requests.
- `N+2`: outgoing audio data.

PTP and sender-initiated NTP sessions do not require a new inbound timing
connection, but the receiver can still send audio retransmission requests to
the control port. The event and video data channels are outbound TCP
connections from doubletake to ports returned by the receiver. Doubletake does
not listen for inbound TCP connections.

No router port forwarding or Internet exposure is needed. If the host firewall
allows local-network traffic, no firewall configuration is necessary. With a
default-deny host firewall, use `-port-range MIN-MAX` to replace unpredictable
ephemeral UDP ports with a range you can allow from the receiver. The range
must contain at least three ports:

```sh
doubletake -target 192.168.1.77 -port-range 60000-60010
```

Daemon mode uses the same range for every managed stream. Reserve at least
three available ports per receiver that may stream simultaneously.

For example, restrict a UFW rule to the receiver's address:

```sh
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.77 proto udp to any port 60000:60010
```

Add a rule for each receiver, or use the trusted LAN subnet as the source. For
nftables/firewalld, add an equivalent inbound UDP rule for the selected source
and range.

NTP and PTP use the same presentation policy; the timing protocol only changes
how timestamps are represented. In automatic mode, an ordinary connection uses
a 75 ms video lead and an 85 ms screen-audio lead.

## Password-protected receivers

If the receiver has **Require Password** enabled (on an Apple TV: Settings →
AirPlay and HomeKit), it challenges the mirroring `SETUP` request with HTTP
Digest auth and mirroring fails with `HTTP 401` until doubletake answers it.
Pass the password with `-code`:

```sh
DOUBLETAKE_CODE='...' doubletake -target 192.168.1.77
```

`-code` carries whatever the receiver is asking for — the onscreen pairing PIN
during `-pair`, or the fixed password when "Require Password" is enabled.
`$DOUBLETAKE_CODE` is preferred over the flag: a command line is visible to
other users via `ps` and lands in shell history. The environment variable takes
precedence when both are set.

Pairing and Digest authentication remain separate wire protocols, but
doubletake deliberately uses one credential flow for both: a PIN/password
entered during pairing is retained for later Digest challenges and reconnects.
A receiver may consume that value during pairing, Digest auth, both, or neither.
Supplying `-code` does not by itself trigger re-pairing.

When the capability policy selects first-party CoreUtils/HAP pairing, a
configured fixed password is reserved for Digest authentication and is never
reused as an SRP pairing PIN, including with `-pair`. A legacy/HKP pairing flow
may consume the same entered value during both SRP and Digest when its protocol
requires it.

The CLI and Plasma applet prompt once after inspecting the receiver's security
mode. In the Plasma applet, an on-screen PIN uses a visible four-digit field,
while a configured password uses an unrestricted masked field. Doubletake does
not request or claim that a PIN is visible in password mode. The daemon exposes
the distinction while retaining `doubletake-ctl pin <PIN-or-password>` for
command compatibility when exactly one receiver is waiting. With concurrent
prompts, submit each value with `doubletake-ctl connect TARGET PIN-or-password`.

One thing that makes this confusing to diagnose: **"Require Password" is a
fixed password you set, not a rotating onscreen code.** Nothing appears on the
TV during `-pair`, and the prompt is asking for that configured password.

Run with `-debug` to see the challenge and whether the retry was accepted.

## Usage

# Discover Apple TVs on the network and stream
doubletake

# Disable audio for video-only mirroring
doubletake -no-audio

doubletake -target 192.168.1.77 -creds airplay-credentials.json

# Adjust stream settings (bitrate 0 = auto)
doubletake -target 192.168.1.77 -fps 30 -bitrate 0

# Force a lower bitrate on weaker Wi-Fi
doubletake -target 192.168.1.77 -bitrate 4500

# Override the automatic audio/video playout latencies with one joint value
doubletake -target 192.168.1.77 -target-latency-ms 100

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-target` | | Apple TV IP (skip mDNS discovery) |
| `-port` | 7000 | AirPlay port |
| `-code` | | Pairing PIN shown on the receiver, or its configured password when "Require Password" is enabled (see [Password-protected receivers](#password-protected-receivers)); prefer `$DOUBLETAKE_CODE` |
| `-port-range` | | Local UDP range for timing/audio and receiver control traffic (at least 3 ports) |
| `-cred-backend` | `file` | Credential backend (`file` or `keyring`) |
| `-creds` | `~/.config/doubletake/credentials.json` | Credentials file path |
| `-pair` | false | Force new pairing |
| `-fps` | 30 | Frames per second |
| `-bitrate` | 0 | Video bitrate in kbps (`0` = auto) |
| `-target-latency-ms` | 0 | Joint audio/video playout latency override in milliseconds (`0` = automatic wired/wireless profiles with separate audio/video defaults) |
| `-hwaccel` | auto | Encoder preference: `auto`, `nvenc`, `vaapi`, `openh264`, `none` |
| `-video-codec` | auto | Screen codec: compatible H.264 `auto`, forced `h264`, or forced `hevc` |
| `-no-encrypt` | false | Disable RTSP header encryption (debugging only) |
| `-direct-key` | false | Use `shk`/`shiv` directly without SHA-512 derivation |
| `-no-audio` | false | Disable audio streaming |
| `-test` | false | Use synthetic video source |
| `-daemonize` | false | Run as background daemon with Unix socket control interface |
| `-socket` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/doubletake.sock` | Daemon control socket path |
| `-debug` | false | Verbose debug logging |

Only `-hwaccel auto` tries fallback encoders, in the order `vulkanh264enc`,
`nvh264enc`, `vah264enc`, `openh264enc`, then `x264enc`. Explicit selections
fail if their required GStreamer encoder is unavailable; `none` forces x264 for
H.264 or x265 for explicitly requested HEVC.
The normal `-video-codec auto` path uses H.264 at the receiver's nominal canvas
for compatibility across AirPlay receiver generations. Explicit
`-video-codec hevc` remains available with `nvh265enc` or `x265enc`; use
`-hwaccel none` to force the software path.

Main10 alone does not turn an SDR X11 or portal capture into HDR: doubletake
preserves encoder-provided HDR SEI but does not invent PQ/HLG mastering metadata
or relabel SDR colors as HDR.

### Daemon Control (`doubletake-ctl`)

```sh
doubletake-ctl status
doubletake-ctl discover
doubletake-ctl devices
doubletake-ctl connect [target] [PIN-or-password]
doubletake-ctl pin <PIN-or-password>
doubletake-ctl disconnect [target]
doubletake-ctl mute [target]
doubletake-ctl unmute [target]
```

- `disconnect` without a target stops all active streams.
- `disconnect <target>` stops only that receiver.
- `mute`/`unmute` can operate globally or per target.
- `pin` retains its historical command name, but submits whichever credential
  the daemon requests: an on-screen PIN or a configured password. It is
  targetless and therefore requires exactly one waiting receiver; use
  `connect <target> <PIN-or-password>` when multiple receivers are waiting.

Daemon streams are grouped by codec and the normalized even-sized canvas resolved
during each receiver's SETUP. Targets with the same key share one capture and
encoder; targets with a different codec or canvas use independent encoders,
so connection order does not determine another receiver's size. For example, a
receiver reporting a 1920x1080 canvas and a 3840x2160 maximum joins the
1920x1080 H.264 group in automatic mode. An explicit HEVC request uses the
maximum canvas and forms a separate group.
Fan-out uses a bounded queue per target within each group. A
stalled target is detached when its queue fills, without blocking peers that
share the encoder. Other canvas groups continue independently as well.

## Disclaimer

The majority of code for this project was written by LLMs. I've read through the code to make sure there's nothing obviously stupid, but if you're in a production or security-sensitive environment and need to use AirPlay (for whatever reason), do not use this project.

Since I assume most of the code for this project was trained from [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay) and similar projects, I've provided this project under a similar license. Most of the reverse engineering work has already been done by many other people and this project would not be possible without them.
